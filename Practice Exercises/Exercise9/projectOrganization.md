# Project Organization
Instructions: Find or create a complex Java project.

## I am going to build a web based operating systems with things I use daily. Such as a pompadouro time, ambience music, a to-do list, and I will incorperate a chatbox feature using ChatGPT's API



>How is this project divided into classes?

We can divide the pompadouro timer as one class, ambience music as another, a to-do list as another, and the holy grail the chatgpi api as its own
we can stack these classes, together and have a full web site


> what is the purpose of each class?

The pompadouro timer will have a 30 minute timer, and a 5 min timer, and after 3 consectuitve 30 minute timeres, a 15 minute timer will appear

The to-do list, will have a list of task, we can edit, add, and delete the items, the deleted items will be soft deleted, and delete after 7 days

the ambienace music background is still in consideration

the chatGPT textbox, will be a chatbox, where I can quickly ask questions lol

I want to include a weather box too
